Chinese landscape paintings convey emotion through artistic conception and brush-and-ink techniques, yet existing visual emotion analysis studies fail to capture the distinctive traits of this art form. To overcome this limitation, we first introduce SS-VAD, a benchmark dataset of 5,573 paintings with continuous valence arousal dominance annotations. We further propose a novel three-stream spectral-domain Mamba network that disentangles the complex ink textures and spatial structures of landscape paintings. By introducing a cross-gated Mamba module, the framework elegantly fuses three pathways: an FFT-based spectral stream that captures micro-level ink variations in the frequency domain, a DINOv2-based foundational stream that leverages large-scale pre-trained knowledge, and a spatial stream that extracts macro-level semantics. Finally, a quaternion complementary mixture-of-experts prediction head performs dynamic feature routing and precise regression. Experiments on SS-VAD show that TSS-Mamba significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that combining frequency-domain analysis with large-scale foundation models is an effective route for computational art emotion understanding.
